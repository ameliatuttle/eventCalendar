# Overview

For this project I wanted to accomplish learning a new programming language and updating old code. This program is a simple event calendar that keeps tracks of events and displays any calendar since 1753. I had previously written a small algorithm in python that creates any calendar since the start of the gregorian calendar. I thought that a good challenge would be to update that code to be more clean and in a new language. 

Other than displaying an accurate calendar, this program lets you track events by writing them to a .txt file. There are 5 classes: Main, Day, Event, Calendar, and Planner. Main initializes the classes and passes user input to the various methods. Day represents an individual day on the calander and handles its events. Event represents a single event in a day and holds its description. Calendar holds the logic from my old program that can create any calendar after 1753 and display it in a readable way. Planner handles all of the events on different days and writes them to an external file.

Java is still one of the most used coding languages today, so I thought now would be a great time to start learning about it. I've realized just how similar coding is between object-oriented languages. The syntax of Java felt for similar to C++ and C#. The more I learn and explore in any progrmming language the better I'll be in all of them.

# Development Environment

The tools I used for this project are IntelliJ IDE, JDK, and mosh tutorials. After doing some research it was recommended that I try the IDE IntelliJ. It's built for Java so it's supposed to be more efficient, but personally I wasn't a fan. By the end I was using VScode again, and I had just installed the Java extention so it would work. I had to download a JDK (Java Devlopment Kit) so that I could run my project in the terminal. I really like getting more and more familiar with my CLI as I explore more into coding.

Java is a high-level class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. This means that it isn't dependent on other softwares to run. Java was created by Sun Microsystems in 1991 and was named after their favorite drink, Java. In my program I used packages like java.io and java.util.scanner. Java.io is used to read and write to a file and the scanner package is used to read input from the terminal.
